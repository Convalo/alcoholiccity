        <p>Believe it or not, there are cities in the U.S. which are known for their prodigiously voluminous drinking. Not in the least an honorary achievement, the amount one metropolis can put back is more ribbing than factual information. </p>

<p>Problem with this, though, is if you associate yourself with these bent-elbow stat makers, you might indeed develop your own drinking problem, which can lead you down a rabbit hole wrought with darkness.</p>

<p>What kind of darkness? you ask.
Job loss, marriage loss, loss of health and social standing.
Lots of loss which adds up to lots of darkness.</p>

<p>If you do fall down that rabbit hole, the first thing you need to do is find new friends/relations. This is, of course, once you decide to do something about your addiction. Because that’s what it’s probably turned into now – an addiction.</p>

<p>Of course, sure, you could move from your alcoholic city, but how realistic is that, if at all? No, your best choice is to separate yourself from your enablers as you seek out treatment.</p>

<p>Also separate yourself from all triggers such as old hangouts, bars, reoccurring parties and other events so as you can leave yourself breathing room for your budding recovery, fragile as it is/will be.</p>

<h2>
<a id="find-your-treatment-center" class="anchor" href="#find-your-treatment-center" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>FIND YOUR TREATMENT CENTER</h2>

<p>A city that likes chicken is bound to have one or two chicken drive-thrus. A city that likes coffee will invariably have coffee shops, coffee houses and anything else coffee-related.</p>

<p>The same can be said for a city that likes its booze; one way or the other there has to be a nearby treatment facility that can help you overcome your addiction.</p>

<p>Begin searching now. The longer you wait, the worse your problem will grow. It’s better to stop your slide halfway down the rabbit hole than hit bottom where a whole host of other misfortune might lay.</p>
